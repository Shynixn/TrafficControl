subsystem reports regularly the numbers of cars on a street to the roadmaintenance which gets notified. As the roadmaintenance actors has
got the statistical information about the state of a road it has to regularly schedule repairs which includes recording the street state and
optionally trigger a maintenance case if the street is in a bad state.
