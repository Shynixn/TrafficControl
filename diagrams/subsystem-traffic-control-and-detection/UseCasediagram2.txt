This usecase diagram includes 2 different actors, the control system and traffic participant, which are both part of the traffic control system.
One of the main goals of the control system is to be able to request traffic states which always includes requesting the traffic lights
and the speed limits. The traffic participant can also request the traffic state and trigger
traffic events which can be clicking traffic light button or causing an accident.
